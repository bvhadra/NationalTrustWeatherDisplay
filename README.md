# National Trust Weather Display

This project contains a JavaScript script designed to enhance National Trust property information pages by displaying current weather conditions for each property's location. The goal is to increase user engagement and visitation likelihood by providing relevant weather information directly on property pages.

## Features

- Fetches weather data using a mock endpoint that simulates OpenWeatherMap's API.
- Displays current temperature and weather conditions in an unobtrusive manner.
- Implements A/B testing to measure user engagement impact.

## Usage

To integrate this script into a webpage, simply copy and paste it into the desired location within the HTML file.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of a technical test for enhancing National Trust's web presence.
